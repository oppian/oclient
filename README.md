oclient
=======

oclient contains a very rough and ready desktop AIR client for oppster's oserver.
It was originally written very quickly as a proof of concept against the AIR 1.5.3 SDK and even more quickly ported to AIR 3.3.0.

It should not be used as an example of how to write a good or portable AIR application!
A much better written should be coming along shortly...
